# stressTracker

Developed and trained a transformer-based model for nurse stress prediction using physiological data from the Empatica E4 biosensor. Built an Android application using Android Studio to interface with the Empatica E4 device, process real-time sensor inputs, and apply trained model weights to provide stress-level predictions. The project combines deep learning and mobile application development to support real-time healthcare monitoring and decision-making.
